# SIH_Leaf_Disease_CNN
Convolutional Neural Network model for detecting leaf diseases as part of the Smart India Hackathon project. This repository includes code and resources for training a CNN model to diagnose potential diseases from leaf images, offering recommendations for preventive measures to farmers.


This repository contains the code and resources for the **Smart India Hackathon** project, titled **Farmers Disease Diagnostic/Reporting Portal - Mobile Portal AI-Based**. The project aims to provide farmers with a mobile portal for diagnosing leaf diseases using AI-based image analysis. This solution helps farmers in identifying potential diseases early, allowing for timely intervention and preventive measures.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can classify and diagnose various leaf diseases from images. By submitting leaf images through the mobile portal, farmers can receive insights about possible diseases, along with suggestions for preventive and treatment measures. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that showcases the model development process, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **AI-powered leaf disease detection** using CNN.
- User-friendly portal interface allowing farmers to upload images.
- Early disease diagnosis with suggested preventive measures.
- Mobile-ready, accessible to rural farmers.
